# Defending the himalayas website

This Static Website is being created using HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid, CSS Preprocessor SASS (while refactoring, we may redevelop the website with SASS into order to learn about it). This website is being developed for an organisation named, "Defending the Himalayas" that stands against the abuse of environmental and human rights by different industrial giants and governments in the region.

Through this project we will get into CSS topics like Media Queries, Responsive Web-Design, Animations and Transitions, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, and learn the best practices of front-end web development. 

Please feel free to contribute, and ask questions if you have any.

The website is published at [Test](https://nishkarsh01.github.io/defending-himalayas-website/)
